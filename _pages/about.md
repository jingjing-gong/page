My research interest is centered on Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP) with a specialization in Large Language Models (LLMs), and the application of AI in Life Sciences through generative modeling of bio-molecules. I am fascinated with the vision that, when scaled sufficiently, the generative model could capture the first principle of natural evolution and biophysical rules that result in the proteins and DNAs we used to train the model. When the emergence event happens, there could be a good chance of solving the mystery of life systematically.

I am a versatile and innovative researcher & experienced engineer with extensive expertise in Deep Learning and Probabilistic Machine Learning. I have cultivated systematic thinking and hold the belief that outstanding research requires exceptional engineering.
